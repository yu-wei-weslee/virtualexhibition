image1,image1.png,Women and Children by a Lotus Pond,Wang Qihan (formerly attributed),1100-1299,fan painting mounted as album leaf; ink and colour on silk; 23.9 x 25.8 cm. ,woman; children; fan painting; colour; silk,"This fan painting emphasises Woman as having the capacity to fulfill her domestic duties and as having the capacity to be inspired by artistic pursuits. With a composed face, the woman raises her arm and tries to stop a boy from bullying another boy. She does so with much authority and patience, showing that she is an attentive mother. At the same time, the pile of books on her table highlights that she can read and is well-educated; the scrolls indicate that she has an appreciation for art or even that she may be an artist herself; her collections of the two bronze vessels and the hanging jade disc reveal that she also has an appreciation for antiques. Importantly, the presence of the qin elevates the woman to the same cultural level as a refined male scholar, as qin was generally played and appreciated by men, not women.","Museum of Fine Arts, Boston",Image;StillImage,image/png,Public domain

The mirror and cosmetic box suggest that the woman in the painting cares about her physical beauty. At the same time, similar to Woman and Children by a Lotus Pond, the books and handscroll surrounding her indicate her literary and artistic attainments.

image3,image3.png,"Refined Ladies, Plum Makeup",Artist unknown,1127–1279,bronze mirror; diameter 13.7 cm,women; bronze; mirror,"This bronze mirror highlights Woman as prioritising artistic self-cultivation over physical beauty. The mirror features an image of a group of four married women, two young maids, and a child – all coming together to appreciate art. The women and the girl do not wear fancy clothes, which clearly suggests that they prefer on cultivating their inner virtues instead of adorning themselves. On the back of this mirror is a poem entitled, Gentlewoman, Plum Makeup, which talks about pursuing cultural and artistic accomplishments over outer beauty. Mirrors are used by women to groom themselves on a daily basis. The fact that this artwork is a mirror acts as a reminder to women to not forget about their cultivating inner virtues while they perfect their looks.","Liu, Bo.

image4,image4.png,Watching Mandarin Ducks at a Water Pavilion,Zhou Wenju (formerly attributed),960–1279,ink and colour on silk; 24.5 x 26.7 cm,women; colour; silk,"This fan painting portrays Woman as educated and sophisticated, despite being a figure of longing and desire. The central figure of the painting is married woman awaiting her husband’s return. Although this piece paints a familiar theme of a lonely wife missing her husband and longing for his return, what makes it different is that the woman depicted is not solely occupied with her yearning desire. The plum tree, bamboo, and Taihu rocks in her garden show indicate that she has sophisticated taste. Moreover, the two piles of books on her table point to her literacy. Here, Woman is not simply emotional but intellectual as well.","Liu, Bo. ""Physical Beauty and Inner Virtue: ‘Shinü tu’ in the Song Dynasty""",Image;StillImage,image/png,Public domain
image5,image5.png,Playing Soccer,Artist unknown,960–1279,bronze mirror; diameter 10.7 cm,"woman; man; bronze, mirror","This bronze mirror depicts Woman not as stereotypically sedate and reserved but as active and energetic. The mirror features a couple along with a young maid. The couple is shown playing football together in their home garden. In pre-Song China, football was not typically a “womanly” sport. To portray a woman playing football combats the gender stereotype. Furthermore, to portray a woman playing football alongside a man suggests that, instead of treating men with “great reserve and courtesy” and being submissive to them, women can share the same interests as men and ultimately enjoy being their companions. As the image in the mirror is of a couple, this idea of Woman as Man’s companion is reflected onto husband-wife relationships. With this type of mirror being mass-produced at the time, this new husband-wife relationship was being accepted by a large audience and possibly becoming viewed as an ideal by many families.","Liu, Bo.
